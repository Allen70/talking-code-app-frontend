# Talking Code App

  This site is a tool to help Flatiron students learn about programming through talking code. Talking code is the practice of speaking about code to refine ones understanding. This site offers questions for users to respond to. After offering a response to the question a user can view all responses to a question to further refine their understanding. There are also links to other resources for better understanding.

  To use Talking Code app. One can simply fork and clone the frontend repo found here and the backend repo found <a href="https://github.com/Allen70/talking-code-app-backend">here</a>.
